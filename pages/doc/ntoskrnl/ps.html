      <h1>&nbsp;Process Manager summary</h1>

      <p>
         The process manager of the Executive deals with maintaining, creation of processes, management of internal process data and thread management. A function that lies down in this module starts with a prefix of
         <b>Ps</b>. Functions that begin with <b>Psp</b> are so called -- private functions. A private function is a function that is originally not within export routines list and they're used only in the internal
         source code files of the said module.
      </p>

      <p>
         An important distinction to make is that not every function in process manager kernel service begins with <b>Ps</b>. In fact, shim application management of the said kernel service has functions that start
         with <b>Apphelp</b>.
      </p>
