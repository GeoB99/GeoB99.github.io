            In the part 1 of the article I've discussed what's a blue screen, the contents and their meaning behind a blue screen, how a blue screen works internally and finally what are
            the differences between Windows 9x and NT blue screen internal implementation. And now, in this article I'll cover the baisc techniques to troubleshoot a bugcheck using
            WinDBG and how to read a memory crash dump.

         <!-- Actual content -->
         <p>
            WinDBG is a powerful tool for debugging PE (Portable Executable) files, namely executable process ones (file extension being <b>.exe</b>) and performing reverse engineering.
            WinDBG depends upon PDB (Program database) files which are basically debug symbols in order to fully properly use the tool. WinDBG can be acquired separately from Windows SDK
            without having to install the whole SDK. You can get it from <a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">here</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            I'll be using Windows Server 2003 as the OS target to simulate a bugcheck. Before we dive into that, make sure that you set up the symbol path. To do so, go to <b>File > Symbol File Path</b>
            and paste the following if you haven't done it.
            <br>
            <br>
            <code>
               SRV*C:\path\to\symbols\*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
            </code>
         </p>

         <p>
            I'll explain briefly the syntax and semantics behind this. <code>SRV*</code> informs WinDBG that the PDB symbols must be gathered from a symbols store, an Internet connection is required for
            such procedure. <code>C:\path\to\symbols\</code> is the destination path where you want to store the downloaded symbols in, it's entirely up to you where you want to store them. And finally,
            <code>http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</code> is the symbols URL store where WinDBG will ping the said symbols store and download the PDBs from there. Now it's the time to get started!
         </p>

         <p>
            In this process I'll be simulating a IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bugcheck. The command window of WinDBG should look like this:
         </p>
         <a href = "../images/blue-screen/windbg.png" ><img src = "../images/blue-screen/windbg.png" alt = "WinDBG"></a>
         <p>
            What I exactly did to get IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL? I added an offender call, <code>PsChargePoolQuota</code>, with an invalid POOL_TYPE value within a kernel mode driver. The function
            will write beyond the paged and non paged memory areas thus writing garbage data into the kernel memory space. Windows is not yet aware of this as it hasn't yet accessed such
            garbage data in the memory. This later happens when trying to overwrite the files of the kernel mode driver (whilst not in execution!) from a shared folder.
         </p>

         <h3>&nbsp;&#129154; Obtaining and analyse a call stack</h3>
         <p>
            A <b>call stack</b> is a stack which stores the routines and subroutines recently executed by the processor. Prior the system gets into a fatal crash the system captures the last
            called functions and puts them into the aforementioned stack. To get the information of the call stack backtrace, type <code>kp</code> in the command line within the "Command" window or just
            open the Call Stack window. WinDBG should look like this either way:
         </p>
         <a href = "../images/blue-screen/windbg-call.png" ><img src = "../images/blue-screen/windbg-call.png" alt = "WinDBG Call Stack"></a>
         <p>
            As you can see, Windows has caught a page fault and the operating system is instructed to take special care of this situation and it does that by calling <code>KiTrap0E</code>. That
            function is responsible for handling page faults with the hope of recovering the system but as it turns out, the exception trap handler couldn't be able to proceed further. The interrupt
            request level (IRQL) wasn't at PASSIVE_LEVEL at the time of execution which means the interrupts with ranking level not above or the same to DISPATCH_LEVEL were masked, therefore,
            the system was determined to bugcheck itself. But why's that?
         </p>

         <p>
            As I stated above, the bugcheck occurred when I tried to overwrite the files of the kernel mode driver from a shared folder. The problem goes way deep down to the VirtualBox service process
            and because of that the system wanted to read some corrupt data from a certain address pointed by the first parameter in the bugcheck. Such operation led to the phenomena of a page fault and
            within this condition the IRQL wasn't changed. If we are trying to narrow the actual fault by using <code>ln</code> which points the nearest symbol pointed by the 4 parameter of the bugcheck
            which is, as usual, the function call triggered at the time of the fault.
         </p>
         <a href = "../images/blue-screen/windbg-ln.PNG" ><img src = "../images/blue-screen/windbg-ln.PNG" alt = "WinDBG ln"></a>
         <p>
            The memory manager tried to map corrupt memory data at a different IRQL and the exception handler was invoked to handle such page fault.
         </p>

         <h3>&nbsp;&#129154; Getting verbose details</h3>
         <p>
            Using the <code>!analyze -v</code> command gives you the opportunity to get verbose information about the current instance of a bugcheck. The command window should look like this:
         </p>
         <a href = "../images/blue-screen/windbg-crash.png" ><img src = "../images/blue-screen/windbg-crash.png" alt = "WinDBG Crash"></a>
         <p>
            Obviously I would not be going to review every detail provided by the command so I will explain only the important notes that are worth noting.
         </p>

         <p>
            <b>BUILD_VERSION_STRING</b> -- Build version string of the operating system.
            <br>
            <b>BUGCHECK_P1, BUGCHECK_P2, BUGCHECK_P3, BUGCHECK_P4</b> -- Bugcheck parameters.
            <br>
            <b>READ_ADDRESS</b> -- The read address (if given) at the time of the bugcheck.
            <br>
            <b>CURRENT_IRQL</b> -- Current interrupt request level at the time of the bugcheck.
            <br>
            <b>FAULTING_IP</b> -- The faulting instruction pointer at the time of the bugcheck. The IP is a CPU register that instructs the processor to execute the next code instruction pointed
            by an address.
            <br>

            <br>
            <b>TRAP_FRAME</b> -- The trap (exception) frame captured prior the bugcheck. This frame is useful as it points to the thread which the fault occurred.

         <br>

         <!-- Actual content -->
         <p>
            A crash dump is a file containing debug information about the last instance of a bugcheck hit. Their extension is <b>.dmp</b> and can be opened by WinDBG or any tool
            that supports such extension. The crash dumps can range from simple dumps that provide the minimal information of a bugcheck to kernel and complete dumps. Complete dumps
            are large in size as the name implies, they contain the full details (minimal information + kernel debug information). As usual we'll be using WinDBG to read crash dumps.
            To do so, go to <b>File > Open Crash Dump</b> and locate the path of the said dump. Usually the crash dumps are residing in <b>C:\Windows</b> directory path. WinDBG should
            look as follows:
         </p>
         <a href = "../images/blue-screen/windbg-dump.png" ><img src = "../images/blue-screen/windbg-dump.png" alt = "WinDBG Dump"></a>
         <p>
            WinDBG prepares the loading of the crash dump by first obtaining the PDB files from the symbols store and caching them to the destination directory.
            WinDBG may probably hang during this process and become responsive again so in such case DO NOT close the process!
            Reading a crash dump is the same as doing <code>!analyze -v</code>. Refer to the "Getting verbose details" section above to get a general understanding of what to read
            in a crash dump.
