      <h1>&nbsp;Introduction</h1>

      <p>
        <b>"Introduction to the NT kernel development"</b> is a collection of articles and guidelines for novice people who know coding and OS development but are
        unfamiliar with the tenets of NT and its principles. Such collection covers theoretical aspects, focusing primarily on the internal specifications and their
        purpose of the kernel, the overall infrastructure of the kernel, rules and remarks to be addressed whilst contributing for the NT kernel as well as advanced
        programming topics and whatnot. The articles are also for enthusiasts who wish to know how Windows (and ReactOS) work at the kernel mode level.
     </p>

     <p>
        The collection will be updated regularly based on my experience and overall journey during the course of my contributions to the kernel.
