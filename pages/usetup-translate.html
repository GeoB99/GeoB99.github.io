            What you've learnt in the past is how to translate ReactOS (built-in applications, DLLs, et al) by interacting with resource files of the project, however, translating
            the 1st stage setup component (or internally named as USETUP) is quite different from the general way of translating the project in your language. With that said,
            in this tutorial I'll be showing you how to translate USETUP and compile the translation.

            What makes the translation between other ReactOS modules and USETUP different is the MUI (Multilingual User Interface) internal implementation differences. In ReactOS,
            or rather specifically within the Windows subsystem environment, the user mode software as well as any other module that use resource controls (e.g. static texts,
            combo boxes, dialog boxes, bitmap images, et al) are encapsulated in a file with filename extension format as <code>.rc</code> (which stands for, without a doubt, resource
            control). Such resource files are handled by MUI which in turn such interface is handled by Win32k, the kernel frontend of Windows subsystem environment. This makes the process
            of translating modules of the ReactOS project easier for translators. For more information how to translate ReactOS, please consult <a href = "reactos-translate.html">this</a> article.
         </p>

         <p>
            Although considering the fact that USETUP is a native application module, that is, the application links directly against the Native API (the NTDLL library) and doesn't use
            or depend on any other Windows subsystem environment related libraries such as USER32.DLL, GDI32.DLL and so forth it is pretty obvious that it can't use the resource controls
            of the Windows subsystem. And here's where USETUP comes up with its own MUI implementation. Keep in mind I don't intend to dive too deep into the MUI internals of USETUP as I'll
            only explain the basic details of the MUI design in USETUP to make it clear for people who want to translate USETUP before actually translating this component in the first place. With that said, let's get started.
         </p>

         <p>
            The MUI bases upon the concept of <b>pages</b> and <b>entries</b>. A page is basically the very whole portion of the screen with entries being the actual contents within
            a page. <b>Strings</b> and <b>error strings</b> are the subset of an entry in a page. Such concept that represents the actual functionality under the hood of MUI is implemented
            based upon the data structures declared in <a href = "https://github.com/reactos/reactos/blob/master/base/setup/usetup/mui.h">this header (mui.h)</a>.
         </p>

         <pre id = "prototype">
typedef struct
{
    SHORT X;
    SHORT Y;
    PCSTR Buffer;
    DWORD Flags;
    INT TextID;
} MUI_ENTRY, *PMUI_ENTRY;
         </pre>

         <p>
            <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are the coordinate points of the text, <code>Buffer</code> is the actual buffer string that represents the actual text, <code>Flags</code> denotes
            the MUI text style flags that change the appearance of the said text itself of an entry (such as <b>TEXT_STYLE_NORMAL</b> flag which denotes a normal text and so on) and <code>TextID</code>
            is the unique ID that represents the entry.
         </p>

         <pre id = "prototype">
typedef struct
{
    LONG Number;
    MUI_ENTRY * MuiEntry;
} MUI_PAGE;
         </pre>

         <p>
            As for pages, a page is identified by a number ID, <code>Number</code>, and <code>MuiEntry</code> is the entry in the page. It's worth noting that a page can have multiple
            entries.
         </p>

         <pre id = "prototype">
typedef struct
{
    PCSTR ErrorText;
    PCSTR ErrorStatus;
} MUI_ERROR;
         </pre>
         <pre id = "prototype">
typedef struct
{
    LONG Number;
    PCSTR String;
} MUI_STRING;
         </pre>

         <p>
            As I've told above, strings and error strings are the subset of an entry that operate independently and are declared by their respective data structures on their own. <code>ErrorText</code> is the
            error string in question and <code>ErrorStatus</code> is the status error code that points the nature of the status error. Regarding <code>MUI_STRING</code> is a data structure
            used to denote dynamic strings, which <code>Number</code> represents the unique number instance of the string and <code>String</code> is the buffer that points to the actual string text.
         </p>

         <pre id = "prototype">
typedef struct
{
    PCWSTR LanguageID;
    PCWSTR LanguageDescriptor;
    const MUI_PAGE * MuiPages;
    const MUI_ERROR * MuiErrors;
    const MUI_STRING * MuiStrings;
} MUI_LANGUAGE_RESOURCE;
         </pre>

         <p>
            Finally the last data structure represents the instance of a language locale, or in other words, the details that actually define the language resource as a whole. <code>LanguageID</code> is the
            locale identifier (e.g.<b>00000809</b> is the ID locale for British English), <code>LanguageDescriptor</code> is the descriptor of a language (e.g. <b>English (United Kingdom)</b>) and the last
            three members of the data structure are the MUI contents of a language resource being the pages with respective entries, error and dynamic strings.
         </p>

         <p>
            All in all, this is the basic and overall functionality of MUI in USETUP. Here's a screenshot which demonstrates "Welcome to ReactOS Setup" page, with entries explicitly pointed.

         <h1><u>Translating USETUP</u></h1>

         <br>

         <!-- Actual content -->
         <h3>&nbsp;&#129154; Prepare your translation file</h3>
         <p>
            The translation files of USETUP are located in <a href = "https://github.com/reactos/reactos/tree/master/base/setup/usetup/lang">lang</a> directory, as you'd generally see
            in any other modules of ReactOS that are localised into different languages. As usual the translation files are labelled by their country ISO code (e.g. en-US for the United States of America) with filename
            format as a C header file, unlike the resource files which filename extension format is .rc.
         </p>

         <p>
            As the initial step is to prepare your language translation file by copying the contents from the <b>en-US.h</b> file if the translation file doesn't exist in the directory sources.
            You'll stumble upon several lines as follows.
         </p>
         <a href = "../images/usetup-translate/entry.png" ><img src = "../images/usetup-translate/entry.png" alt = "Entry"></a>
         <p>
            The variables such as <code>enUSSetupInitPageEntries</code> denotes the description about setup initialisation entries. The variables must have the corresponding country ISO language code
            so for example if I have to make a translation file for, let's say Italian, then the variable should be named as <code>itITSetupInitPageEntries</code>. For a list of country locale
            codes please check <a href = "https://www.fincher.org/Utilities/CountryLanguageList.shtml">this</a> page. If you understood the basic concepts of <b>pages</b> and <b>entries</b> of USETUP
            then translating should come easier for you.
         </p>

         <p>
            As you can see in the screenshot, what you can translate are the strings wrapped in double quotes. Bear in mind however there are certain constants such as <code>KERNEL_VERSION_STR</code> which should
            kept alone! The first two parameters are the X/Y coordinate points as you may have looked at the definition declaration of <code>MUI_ENTRY</code> data structure. You can of course
            change such coordinate values accordingly. In all cases the text style flags and text IDs should be kept as they are. The next strings to translate are the error strings as shown in the screenshot below:
         </p>
         <a href = "../images/usetup-translate/errors.png" ><img src = "../images/usetup-translate/errors.png" alt = "Error strings"></a>
         <p>
            This is self-explanatory, you simply translate whatever string wrapped in double quotes. The escape sequence however (<code>\n</code>) and special UTF-8 characters like <code>\x07</code> which
            represents a central dot should be kept as they are! The final pieces to translate are the dynamic strings.
         </p>
         <a href = "../images/usetup-translate/strings.png" ><img src = "../images/usetup-translate/strings.png" alt = "Dynamic strings"></a>
         <p>
            The dynamic strings are used on specific locations of a page where they're displayed accordingly on specific factors such as when an operation requires the user to wait
            then USETUP displays the <code>Please wait...</code> string and it gets removed from the screen once the operation has completed successfully. As the general rule, DO NOT
            translate the ID number constants!
         </p>

         <h3>&nbsp;&#129154; Include the translation file</h3>
         <p>
            The inclusion is done in the similar way as you'd include a resource file in a header, as shown in this screenshot below:
         </p>
         <a href = "../images/usetup-translate/define.png" ><img src = "../images/usetup-translate/define.png" alt = "Include"></a>
         <p>
            And the final step of the inclusion is to define the language MUI resource.
         </p>
         <a href = "../images/usetup-translate/define2.png" ><img src = "../images/usetup-translate/define2.png" alt = "Define resource"></a>
         <p>
            For a list of keyboard language layout identifiers, please check <a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-language-pack-default-values">this</a> page.
            The MUI pages, error and dynamic strings must correspond to their respective locale specific variables from the translation file.

         <!-- Actual content -->
         <p>
            For your translation changes to take effect, you can either compile a boot build by typing <code>ninja bootcd</code> in RosBE or VS command prompt or compile the USETUP
            component standalone by typing <code>ninja usetup</code>. In the latter case in order to test your changes you've to copy the newly compiled <code>usetup.exe</code> native
            executable file located in the compiled sources path and paste into <code>reactos\system32</code> directory path within the compiled ISO build and rename it as <code>smss.exe</code>.
            For this operation you must use a software such as <a href = "http://www.winiso.com">WinISO</a> in order to edit ISO files, you'll end up with unbootable ISO builds otherwise.
