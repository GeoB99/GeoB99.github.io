         <h1>&nbsp;<u>Introduction</u></h1>

         <p>
            Hello! I'm a 22 years old guy living in Italy whom goes by the nickname as GeoB99 around the Internet (formerly I was known as Fraizeraust). I'm a self-taught coder with C being the programming language of interest
            and choice for me, but I also have some bits of expertise in C++, Lua (a scripting language) and web development languages (HTML and CSS). I'm also a multilingual person which I speak
            the following languages: English, Italian and Romanian (whose third language being my mother tongue).

            Apart from coding I do also have several hobbies such as listening to music and whatnot. As main education I studied automotive engineering and worked as an automotive technician. As my current career I work as a
            CNC machinist whose my job is to operate CNC machines for the production of heating elements thorough the analysis and execution of technical drawing sketches.
         </p>

         <h1>&nbsp;<u>Work & Contributions</u></h1>

         <p>
            The first contribution I've made in terms of coding is writing some scripts written in the Lua language for a 2D top-down shooter game called CS2D in 2015. At that time I began dwelling
            and exploring the realm of coding. I programmed the first simple software in C, a CLI (Command Line Interface) calculator.
         </p>

         <p>
            In 2017 I discovered a project going by the name as ReactOS and in the same year I contributed for the first time translating some built-in software programs of the project in Romanian and
            Italian. Later on I began learning how to use the Windows API, understanding the inner architecture and internals of Windows Server 2003 and whatnot. I've been a maintainer for a little while
            for On-Screen Keyboard and developed a built-in program for the project for the first time -- the <a href="https://github.com/reactos/reactos/tree/master/base/applications/utilman">Accessibility Utility Manager</a>.
            Currently my main area of interest is NT kernel development and NTDLL APITESTs testcases infrastructure. Speaking of which, I publish tutorial articles regarding NT kernel development internals.
            You can find my commit contributions <a href = "https://github.com/reactos/reactos/commits?author=GeoB99">in this page</a>.
